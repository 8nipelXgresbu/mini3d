7. Save your results as a text file, an image file or a script file for future use or analysis.

Thermocalc 5.rar is a powerful and versatile software that can help you solve complex problems in thermodynamics and phase equilibria. However, it requires some knowledge and experience in using it correctly and interpreting the results. If you need more help or information, you can refer to the user manual, the online documentation or the support forum of Thermocalc.
  
## Examples of using Thermocalc 5.rar
 
To illustrate the capabilities of Thermocalc 5.rar, we will show you some examples of using it for different applications. These examples are based on the tutorials and examples provided by Thermocalc Software.
 
### Example 1: Calculating the liquidus temperature of an alloy
 
One of the simplest calculations that Thermocalc can perform is to find the liquidus temperature of an alloy, which is the temperature at which the alloy starts to melt. To do this, we need to specify the alloy composition and the database file that contains the thermodynamic data for the alloy system. For this example, we will use the Fe-Cr-Ni system and the database file tcni6.tdb.
 
We can enter the following commands in Thermocalc:

    set database tcni6
    enter system fe cr ni
    enter condition x(cr)=0.2
    enter condition x(ni)=0.3
    enter option gridmin=0.01
    calculate equilibrium with t p

The output results will show us the liquidus temperature of the alloy:

    T= 1628.9 K
    P= 1E5 Pa

We can also plot the phase diagram of the Fe-Cr-Ni system by entering:

    plot phase diagram with t x(cr) x(ni)

We will see a plot like this:
